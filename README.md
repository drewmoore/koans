Koans
=====
__The path to enlightenment__

Koans is a collection of exercises created by Neo Software Artisans.  Its purpose is in teaching the Ruby programming language
to novices.  The teaching method is somewhat unique in the sense that it assumes no prior familiarity with Ruby.  The exercises
are written as a series of tests that are set to fail.  The uninitiated developer begins by fixing a very simple error, using
intuition alone. The tests become increasingly more complex, each
building upon the experience gained from prior exercises.  This pedagogical approach is similar to the strategy used in the
Rosetta Stone suite of software for learning foreign languages.

This repository demonstrates my own mastery of the koans.
